# avl-binary-search-tree
AVL-Type Binary Search Tree for Vilnius University Algorithm and Data Structures class  
  
A type of self-balancing BST implemented in C using two different structures and pointers. The code has simple functionality of a AVL tree (insertion, deletion, lookup, rotations) ,but no advanced features such as traversal (might add it later).  
The header file (BST.h) has in-depth information about the implementation and usage.  
This was a task for my Algorithm and Data Structures class and as such, it is intended to be used by others to a certain extent.

You are free to repurpose the code or use it as an example to make your own AVL tree.
